# Understanding Policies of Deep RL Agents

The goal of the project is to explain and visualise how deep reinforcement learning agents take actions.

Please look at line 186 in app.py and change the interval value according to your processing power, then run app.py to see the local live demo.

The project uses Atari Learning Environment(ALE), thus you need to install all dependencies appropriately, have to use python3.6, and can't work on Windows due to ALE.
